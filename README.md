<strong>Project Title: Responsive Web Page Design</strong>

<strong>Description:</strong>

For this project, I created a fully responsive web page based on a provided design. The design was delivered in the form of two images: one showcasing the complete website and another detailing fonts and colors. The goal was to implement the layout and styling from scratch using HTML and CSS, ensuring that the page closely aligns with the provided design while adapting the content and styles as needed.

<strong>Technologies Used:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML:</strong> For structuring the content of the web page.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS:</strong> For styling the elements to match the provided design, including layout, fonts, and colors.</li>
  <li><strong>Git/GitHub:</strong> For version control and project management.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Features:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Page Layout:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hero Section:</strong> The top section of the page with prominent text, styled according to the design.</li>
      <li><strong>Main Sections:</strong> Four primary sections (and a footer) that are arranged and styled to reflect the design images. This includes content placement and visual styling.</li>
